###SBA 318: Express Server Application

Build a book comment API 
- Main index page used EJS template. 
- I followed Net Ninja YouTube video to render books page to HTML, but I am not sure how to do that for the comments page, where it needs to show book name from bookId etc.
- There are users, books, and comments three routes.
- All three routes allow POST PATCH DELETE methods.
- Both "books" and "comments" have query option with other route's id.
- Form is the login link from main index page.
